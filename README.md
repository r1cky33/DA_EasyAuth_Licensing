# DA_BASIC_LICENSING

#Funktionality

Very simple, basic HWID (hardware id) license system.

You generate keys with the license server and give the program to the client with a key. On the first run, the client will connect to the server and update its information with the client-computers HWID and activation date. 

After the first activation, the client is able to use the software in the specified time. (+ the software will only work on the activated computer)
